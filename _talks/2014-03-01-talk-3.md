As autonomous robotic platforms are becoming a norm in modern agricultural practices, there is a need to know the real time operational status of these platforms
for their secure functioning as they are on their own. Hence there is a need to seamlessly communication all the data collected and gather it at a single location either locally or on remote computing platforms. Therefore, a wireless data communication platform was developed which consists of MESH radio along with a microcontroller that can be interfaced with these autonomous platforms to capture data from different subsystems and seamlessly transfer it to a single location. The MESH radio utilized has a physical 
range of 40 miles (60 km) line of sigth, a maximum link rate of 276 kpbs, and many more advantages. The data gathered consists of location data and subsystem information.
