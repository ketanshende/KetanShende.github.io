As autonomous robotic platforms are becoming a norm in modern agricultural practices, there is a need to know the real time operational status of these platforms for their secure functioning as they are on their own. Hence there is a need to seamlessly communication all the data collected and gather it at a single location either locally or on remote computing platforms. Therefore, a wireless data communication platform was developed which consists of MESH radio along with a microcontroller that can be interfaced with these autonomous platforms to capture data from different subsystems and seamlessly transfer it to a single location. The MESH radio utilized has a physical range of 40 miles (60 km) line of sigth, a maximum link rate of 276 kpbs, and many more advantages. The data gathered consists of location data and subsystem information. Further the information can be used with knowledge graphs and machine learning to produce valuable insights for the growers. This way, the data collected can be standardized for such kind of subsystems leading to control of many such networks at a time.
